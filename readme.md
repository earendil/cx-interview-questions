# Shopping Basket Pricer

A solution to the Shopping Basket Pricer challenge.

### Dependencies:

* Python3.6+
* Make (optional)

### Usage:

Ipsum Lorem 

Example:
```python

```


### Considerations:

* Assumed that the the job of the basket pricer is to perform the required calculations 
and return the values, leaving the formatting and displaying to a separate specialised component.
* Used the Offers examples to implement, different offers will require further changes.
* Attempted to not use any 3rd party libraries.
* Assumed that baskets will always have items that exists in the catalogue.
* Assumed a basket to be a dictionary with item as key and quantity as value.
* Under the Behaviour section it states that a "Basket cannot have a negative price", I'm assuming it means that a basket cannot have a negative quantity of items as well as the basket pricer cannot have a negative total.
* Given that the objective of the challenge is the implementation of the basket pricer and the interface leaves much to be intepreted, I have assumed basket, catalogue and offers to be as simple as possible and they exist only within tests.
* Assumed that it's the job of team implementing basket to ensure it doesn't have a negative quantity.


### Future Improvements:
