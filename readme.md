# Shopping Basket Pricer

A solution for the Shopping Basket Pricer challenge.

### Dependencies:

* Python3.6+
* Make (optional)

### Usage:

Ipsum Lorem 

Example:
```python

```


### Considerations:

* Assumed that the the job of the basket pricer is to perform the required calculations 
and return the values, leaving the formatting and displaying to a separate specialised component.
* Used the Offers examples to implement, different offers will require further changes.
* Attempted to not use any 3rd party libraries.
